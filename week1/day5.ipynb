      "In our response (myself, coauthored with\n",
      "Yacine Jernite\n",
      "and\n",
      "Irene Solaiman\n",
      "), the overarching message is the following: Open AI systems and open science are fundamental to creating technology that is more performant, efficiently adopted, and secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our recommendations are centered on three interconnected pillars:\n",
      "\n",
      "1️⃣ Recognize Open Source and Open Science as Fundamental to AI Success: \n",
      "The most advanced AI systems today stand on foundations of open research and software. Research has shown that investment in open systems have a strong economic multiplier effect. We need continued investment in public research infrastructure, compute access, and trusted open datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "2️⃣ Prioritize Efficiency and Reliability to Unlock Broad Innovation:\n",
      "Smaller, efficient models enable wider adoption across organizations with varying resources. Purpose-designed AI supports better in-context evaluation and resource utilization. This approach is especially critical in high-risk settings like healthcare.\n",
      "\n",
      "3️⃣ Secure AI through Open, Traceable, and Transparent Systems:\n",
      "Information security history shows that open, transparent systems are essential for security. Different levels of openness can address various security requirements. Open-weight models that can run in air-gapped environments help manage information risks.\n",
